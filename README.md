## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- Practised the mobile menu navigation from how I learnt in the previous frontend mentor challenge.
- Used Grid to create overlapping elements in the features section instead of absolute positioning.

### Continued development

Should continue to learn more about Grid layouts and how easily can manage the layouts without conflicting other elements or sections.
